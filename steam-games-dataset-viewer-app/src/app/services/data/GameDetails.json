It is up to you to recover the hidden treasures from the Devil Kings, and restore peace to the land! Mon-Yu is a turned-based dungeon crawler RPG in the tradition of the original Wizardry. Players can create their own team of heroes from various different classes, and choose an avatar for each hero from a wide selection of different portraits. The demons and monsters that you defeat along the way will drop new weapons and armor for you to use. As your heroes level up, learn new skills, and watch your weapons and armor level up alongside you! Strive to create the strongest team of heroes you can, and defeat the Devil Kings - no matter how many times you die!",
